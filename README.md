# Custom TODO Plugin

This is a custom TODO plugin for Obisidian, which compiles links to all files containing a specified TODO marker into a TODOs tab.

---

### How it works

1. Go to the plugin settings and enter what you'd like to mark your custom TODOs.
	- Default: TODO
	- You can include multiple, divided by a comma (e.g. '-[ ], TODO, ???')
2. Open the TODOs tab (marked by a 💎 (gem) icon) -> Here all of the lines containing these markers in your vault will show up.
	- Note that it may take a second to load depending on vault size.
3. Remaining TODO count will be shown in the bottom-left status bar.
4. As you work, the TODO count and TODOs tab will live update!

### Future Features
No features below are guaranteed.

- Sort list of TODOs (by most recent, oldest, alphabetical, etc.)
- Highlight files containing TODOs on Graph View
- Possibly gameify plugin to encourage clearing of TODOs (TBD) -> statistics on TODO count completed, percentage completed, calendar view?
